Simple distributed key-value store with consistency
guarantees
- Programming language: Go
- Implement a simple distributed key-value store with
  consistency guarantees
  • Operations: get(key), put(key, value), delete(key)
  • Clients can request operations to any replica
  • Provide consistency guarantees
  • Sequential consistency using logical scalar clocks
  • Causal consistency using logical vector clocks
- Test solution (at least 3 replicas)
- Deployment using Docker Compose and EC2 instance
- emulation of network delays to simulate delays
  in the message transmission among different replicas

# Implementation
